2. **File Organization**
   - Created `index.html` as the entry point for the modular version
   - Extracted CSS to `css/styles.css`
   - Organized JavaScript into component files in `js/` directory:
     - `main.js`: Game initialization and main loop
     - `world.js`: World generation and terrain management
     - `robot.js`: Robot entity logic, physics, and AI

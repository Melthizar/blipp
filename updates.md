# Project Updates

## April 6, 2025 - Code Modularization

### Major Changes:
1. **Modularized Code Structure**
   - Converted the original monolithic `blipp.html` into separate modular components
   - Created an improved project architecture following software engineering best practices
   - Preserved the original file for reference

2. **File Organization**
   - Created `index.html` as the entry point for the modular version
   - Extracted CSS to `css/styles.css`
   - Organized JavaScript into component files in `js/` directory:
     - `main.js`: Game initialization and main loop
     - `world.js`: World generation and terrain management
     - `robot.js`: Robot entity logic, physics, and AI
     - `inventory.js`: Item system and inventory management
     - `renderer.js`: Canvas drawing and visual effects

3. **Code Improvements**
   - Implemented revealing module pattern for better encapsulation
   - Created clear module APIs with limited exposure of internal details
   - Improved code readability and maintainability
   - Added proper CSS class for game info text (replacing inline styling)

4. **Project Structure Cleanup**
   - Consolidated multiple copies of files into a single clean structure
   - Removed duplicate directories (`blipp/web/` and `web/`)
   - Created `backup/` directory containing older versions
   - Updated README.md with project documentation

5. **Preserved Original Version**
   - Kept original `blipp.html` in the root directory
   - Created a backup copy of the original in `static/original_robot_game.html`

### Benefits of Modularization:
- Easier maintenance - changes to one system don't affect others
- Better code organization - logical separation of concerns
- Improved readability - smaller, focused files instead of one large file
- Extensibility - easier to add new features to specific modules
